          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <b>
            Cars is Latin America’s largest integrated car e-commerce platform. With
            presence across Argentina, Uruguay, Brasil and Chile, we aim to digitalize the
            region’s used car industry by reshaping and elevating the car buying and
            selling experience.
          </b>
          <p>
            Cars provides end-to-end solutions to consumers and used car dealers, from car
            inspection to ownership transfer to financing, promising a service that is
            trusted, convenient and efficient.

          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <b>
            We first started as a used car selling platform where we help customers sell
            their used cars through a trusted, convenient and fast process.
          </b>
          <p>
            This simple process starts with booking an appointment online. Our extensive
            175-point inspection process is free and takes only 30 minutes at a Cars
            Inspection Center.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our highly-trained inspectors are well-equipped to provide a complete car
            condition report before an on-the-spot offer is given. Alternatively,
            customers can proceed with bidding where our network of dealers will have the
            chance to place a bid. After the sale is confirmed, all paperwork will be
            handled by us.
